## Language guide overview

The Beef language guide is a work in progress and serves as a introduction to the Beef programming language. 

For those who like to learn by example, Beef includes several example projects which illustrate the basics of the language concepts. Source code for the Beef IDE and associated tools is available on GitHub and can serve as an example of full-scale projects.
